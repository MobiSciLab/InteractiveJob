# InteractiveJob

VietnamWorks would like to roll out an App that uses Augmented Reality to help jobseekers to search for jobs in a more interactive way. For this challenge, MobiSci Lab will create a Android application that will allow VietnamWorks IT users to search for jobs by pointing their phoneâ€™s camera to a company logo or company building entrance.
